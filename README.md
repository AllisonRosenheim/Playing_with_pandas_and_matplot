# Pandas & Matplot in Python

Hello, my name is Allison. I am just starting my journey as a programmer. To start
I am familiarizing myself with the pandas and matplot modules in python. I am currently
taking two courses to introduce myself to python programming. IT-140 (intro to scripting) & MAT-243 (applied statistics)
As I progress in these courses and in my own research I will update this project and explore different ways to
interpret and display data.

## Features
- latest python version
- matplot
- pandas
